Recently the Vue team announced the release of Vue CLI 3.0 which was a major rewrite of this already amazing tool.</p><p>The Vue Command Line Interface (CLI) is a tool that allows you to configure some options about your project and scaffold out everything you need to get started. In this presentation, we will talk all about what the CLI can do, walk through the generated code and together we will build our first VueJS application.</p><p>Not comfortable with the command line? The Vue CLI 3 ships with a full-blown GUI that not only create new projects, but also manages the plugins and tasks inside your project.</p><p>I really look forward to our first meetup together and I hope you’re all as excited as I am to geek out over Vue.</p>"

In his demo he will be getting data from the NYT Movies Critic API and posting the critics name and short summary to the page. He will then allow users to click a pair of buttons on whether this review was helpful or not. The data from those clicks will be posted to our local MYSQL db.</p><p>He will be using Laravel and will spend the first 5 minutes kind of explaining Laravel, why I use it, and a brief shout out to Lumen, Laravel's step brother, which is perfect for crafting simple API backends.</p>",

Does that mean they can't join the modern JavaScript party? Will they forever be left out of the fancy JavaScript parade?</p><p>No! You don't have to adopt an entire JavaScript framework to add component functionality to your traditional website or blog. You can instead use the Web Component standard to create your very own HTML tags with all of the power and tooling of Vue backing it up. This talk will show how you can create our own, dynamic HTML tags using the Custom Elements standard built into all major browsers and the Vue JavaScript framework. Attendees will learn how to create encapsulated JavaScript components that can then be compiled into Custom Elements and included on any web page, SPA or not.</p>",

This could be a project you're working on at work or in your spare time. This could be something as small as a library or a personal site you built for yourself. The idea of this is to show off something that you are excited about so that others might learn about something new or get inspired to build something themselves.</p>"

With a couple of caveats, Nuxt will allow you to create applications that support SSR the same way you would write a SPA application. We’ll go over how to get up and running with Nuxt, configuring your application for SSR, and how to generate pre-rendered static sites.</p>",
